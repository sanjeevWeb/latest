He know his strengths and weeknesses so he is taking required number of soldiers with him. King can only defeat enemies with strongest and weakest power, and one soldier can only kill one enemy. Your task is to calculate that how many soldiers are required by king to take with him for the war.<br>
<strong>Note: </strong>The array may contain duplicates.</span><br>

<p><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Example 1:</strong></span></p>

<pre><span style="font-size:18px"><strong>Input:</strong>
N = 2
A[] = {1, 5}
<strong>Output:</strong>
0
<strong>Explanatation:
</strong>The king will itself be able to defeat all the enemies.</span></pre>
